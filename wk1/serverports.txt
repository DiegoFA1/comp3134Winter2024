1) What is the definition of server port?

A server port is a communication endpoint in a computer network,
is a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server

2) What is server port range?

The server port range refers to the range of port numbers that can be used by a server for communication purposes.
port numbers range from 0 to 65535

3) How many bits does number above represent?

The range of port numbers from 0 to 65535 represents a total of 16 bits

4) State 10 common server ports

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Port: 80 (TCP)
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) Port: 443 (TCP)
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) Port: 21 (TCP)
SSH (Secure Shell) Port: 22 (TCP)
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) Port: 25 (TCP)
POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) Port: 110 (TCP)
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) Port: 143 (TCP)
DNS (Domain Name System) Port: 53 (UDP/TCP)
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Port: 67 (UDP) and 68 (UDP)
RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) Port: 3389 (TCP)


_______________________________________________
Explanation(s)

These common server ports go into the category of Well-Known Ports (0-1023), these are reserved for standard services and protocols
and are typically assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

The port numbers are in the range from 0 to 1023 (0 to 2^10 âˆ’ 1)
